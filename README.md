# HUman-FACE-Det
MINI PROJECT


HI, Welcome 
This a project in which we deployed a model called CNN which a famous neural network architecture in deep learning.
Our Model's objective is to verify the given input image is human face or not.
We worked 3 as a team where each one performed some task.
For this project we collected the ORL dataset which contains number of human face images which is being attached.
We augumented that dataset into vast number of samples so that model can able to predict more accurately.
And then we combined both the original dataset and augmented dataset and given it to the CNN model.
Our model is able to give the accuracy of 98.8.
Our model can be further developed and can be useful for the systems like face based attendance systems.
Thank you.
